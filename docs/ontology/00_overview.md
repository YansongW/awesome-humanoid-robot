## 1. The Central Question

This ontology is organized around one question:

> **What does it take to go from 0 to 1 for humanoid robot mass production and industrial application?**

Answering this requires more than a list of papers or companies. It requires understanding how every layer of the system interacts:

- The price of neodymium magnets affects actuator cost.
- Actuator cost and torque density determine feasible robot morphology.
- Morphology and design choices determine manufacturability.
- Manufacturing yield determines whether mass production is economically viable.
- Mass production cost determines which applications are profitable.
- Application requirements feed back into design, AI, and component priorities.

An ontology lets us express these dependencies and place every entry in the context of the full journey.

- Lithium, nickel, cobalt for batteries
- Copper for windings and wiring
- Aluminum, magnesium, carbon fiber for lightweight structures
- Silicon for compute chips and sensors
- Steel and titanium for load-bearing parts

**Why it matters**: Supply constraints and price volatility in raw materials directly affect robot cost and availability.

**Question**: What are the major building blocks of a humanoid robot?

| Subsystem | Examples | Key Metrics |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| Actuation | Electric motors, hydraulic actuators, pneumatic muscles, series elastic actuators | Torque density, speed, efficiency, cost |
| Power | Battery packs, power distribution, thermal management | Energy density, cycle life, charge time |
| Sensing | Cameras, LiDAR, IMU, tactile sensors, force/torque sensors, joint encoders | Resolution, latency, robustness, cost |
| Compute | Edge GPUs, embedded controllers, SOCs | TOPS, latency, power consumption |
| Structure | Skeleton, joints, links, end effectors | Strength-to-weight, manufacturability |
| Communication | Buses (CAN, EtherCAT), wireless | Bandwidth, latency, reliability |

**Why it matters**: Component performance determines what a robot can physically do and at what cost.

- Stator/rotor winding, magnet insertion
- Gear hobbing, grinding, honing for reducers
- PCB fabrication and SMT assembly
- Cable harness assembly
- Surface treatment and coating

**Why it matters**: Process choice determines precision, yield, cost, and scalability.

---

### 04 Assembly, Integration & Testing

**Question**: How is a humanoid robot put together and validated?

- Subassembly: legs, torso, arms, head, hands
- System integration: wiring, calibration, software flashing
- Test benches: joint performance, static/dynamic balance
- Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testing
- Environmental testing: temperature, vibration, dust
- Safety testing: collision behavior, emergency stop

**Why it matters**: This is where design intent meets physical reality. High integration complexity is a major bottleneck.

---

### 05 Mass Production & Scaling

**Question**: How do you go from one working robot to thousands?

- Factory layout and automation
- Supply chain coordination
- Quality control at scale
- BOM cost reduction
- Production ramp and yield curves

**Why it matters**: Design choices constrain everything downstream: cost, performance, reliability, and applications.

---

### 07 AI Models & Algorithms

**Question**: What intelligence enables the robot to perceive, decide, and act?

- **Perception**: visual processing, 3D reconstruction, object detection, tactile interpretation
- **Planning**: task planning, motion planning, footstep planning, manipulation planning
- **Control**: balance control, whole-body control, impedance/admittance control
- **Learning**: imitation learning, reinforcement learning, sim-to-real transfer
- **Foundation models**: VLAs, world models, LLM-based planners
- **Loco-manipulation**: combined locomotion and manipulation policies

**Why it matters**: This is the layer most public attention focuses on, but it is only meaningful when combined with capable hardware.

---

### 08 Software & Middleware

**Question**: What software infrastructure connects algorithms to hardware?

- Real-time operating systems and middleware (ROS 2, DDS, EtherCAT)
- Simulation environments (Isaac Sim, MuJoCo, Gazebo, Genesis)
- Digital twins

---

### 09 Data & Datasets

**Question**: What data is needed to train and evaluate humanoid robots?

- Teleoperation demonstrations
- Human motion capture
- Simulation-generated data
- Real-world interaction logs
- Multimodal datasets (vision, language, action, force)
- Data licensing and privacy

**Why it matters**: Data is the fuel for learning-based methods. High-quality, diverse data is often scarcer than algorithms.

---

### 10 Evaluation & Benchmarks

**Question**: How do we know a humanoid robot is good?

- Simulation benchmarks (Isaac Gym, HumanoidBench, etc.)
- Real-world task benchmarks
- Hardware-in-the-loop evaluation

## 4. Cross-Cutting Relationships

The domains are not independent. Key relationships include:

- **Raw materials → Components**: magnet supply affects motor performance and cost.
- **Components → Design**: actuator torque density determines feasible morphology.
- **Design → Manufacturing**: design for manufacturability (DFM) determines yield.
- **Manufacturing → Mass Production**: process capability determines scaling potential.
- **AI Models → Components**: algorithms can compensate for sensor/actuator limitations, or require better hardware.
- **Data → AI Models**: data availability constrains learning-based approaches.
- **Benchmarks → Applications**: benchmarks should reflect real deployment needs.
- **Policy → Applications**: regulation determines which markets are accessible.
- **Markets → Investment → R&D**: market pull drives upstream innovation.

These relationships are captured in per-domain documents through **cross-links**.
